Use basename(): 
The basename() function shall return a pointer to the final component of path, which is preventing traversal beyond the html directory.


Use file_exists(): 
It can check if it exists or not first to avoid accessing non-existent or invalid directories.


Prevent passing a filename: 
Checking if there is a dot in the path. If there is a dot, means it's a filename, if no, it's a directory. So if it is a filename, an error will be displayed.
